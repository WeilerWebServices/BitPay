Python Library for integrating with BitPay
-------------------------------------

This library is compatible with Python 2.7.8. It is not compatible with Python 3.

This library is a simple way to integrate your application with
BitPay for taking bitcoin payments. It exposes three basic
functions, authenticating with bitpay, creating invoices,
and retrieving invoices. It is not meant as a replacement for
the entire BitPay API. However, the key_utils module contains
all of the tools you need to use the BitPay API for other
purposes.
